## Project Info

This project is build using the following packages:

- React Native UI Lib [[link]](https://wix.github.io/react-native-ui-lib/)
  - This package provide most of the UI elements to build the functionlities of this app
- duix [[link]](https://github.com/BrodaNoel/duix)
  - A simple state management library to manage form input & settings states.
- SQLite
  - Transaction history are stored using SQLite database.
- Auth
  - If user device did not enrolled in any biometric or pin/pattern lock, transaction auth will fallback to use a hardcoded app in which is 123456.
- Mock API status can be change using the 'setting' icon on the top right of the App Header.
- The app will use dark/light theme based on device OS theme setting.

## Things that can be improved

- The dark/light theme code is kind bloated and need to cleanup.
- Click on the transaction history will only pre-fill the recipient input field, aas the amount field is not controlled & I have not yet found way to pre-fill the amount input field.
- Authentication function can be move into a custom hook.
